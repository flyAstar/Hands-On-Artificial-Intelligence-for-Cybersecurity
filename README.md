This is the code repository for [Hands-On Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity](https://www.packtpub.com/in/data/hands-on-artificial-intelligence-for-cybersecurity?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789804027), published by Packt.

**Implement smart AI systems for preventing cyber attacks and detecting threats and network anomalies**（网络异常）

## What is this book about?
If you wish to design smart, threat-proof cybersecurity systems using trending AI tools and techniques, then this book is for you. With this book, you will learn to develop intelligent systems that can detect suspicious（可疑的） patterns and attacks, thereby allowing you to protect your network and corporate assets（公司资产）.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Detect email threats such as spamming and phishing（垃圾邮件和钓鱼） using AI
* Categorize（分类） APT, zero-days, and polymorphic malware（多态恶意软件） samples（样本）
* Overcome antivirus limits in threat detection
* Predict network intrusions（预防网络入侵） and detect anomalies（检测异常） with machine learning
* Verify the strength（验证 强度） of biometric authentication procedures（生物特征认证程序） with deep learning

## Instructions and Navigations（说明和导航）
All of the code is organized into folders. For example,

The code will look like the following:
```
In [ ]:
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA   

pca = PCA(n_components=2)               
pca.fit(X_data)                         
X_2D = pca.transform(X_data)            
data_df['PCA1'] = X_2D[:, 0]
data_df['PCA2'] = X_2D[:, 1]
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you’re a cybersecurity professional or ethical hacker（道德黑客/白帽子，[White hat (computer security)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security))） who wants to build intelligent systems using the power of machine learning and AI, you’ll find this book useful. Familiarity with cybersecurity concepts and knowledge of Python programming is essential to get the most out of this book.对于本书，熟悉网络安全概念和Python编程知识至关重要
